# Trailers

http://iangilman.com/trailers/

## Development

Run it with MAMP or some such, and go to http://localhost:8888/play/ to see it in action.

## To Do

### Soon

* Additional RSS feeds (DVD's etc.)
* Keep track of movies we've seen by normalized title as well (so we don't load things we don't need)

### Normal

* 'Still there?' check every 30 minutes
* Analytics
* Fullscreen
* If YouTube vid doesn't match name, kill it?
* Detect Firefox's 'activate Flash' mode and allow the user to click it?
* Differentiate between before and after interstitials
* If already upvoted, don't play end interstitial
* Smoother transitions between trailers and interstitials
* Load the next thing while the current thing is playing?
* Key for flagging problem trailers
* Better error reporting
* Use http://docs.themoviedb.apiary.io/reference/configuration/configuration/get
* Store TMDB data as a sub-property
* Use Firebase?
* Filter by genre?
* Use TMDb trailers?
* Modernizr checks?

### Mobile

* Add some informative intro
* Show the movie name while the next video buffers?
